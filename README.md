# Modelling

A simple model to work out how many sequencing reactions we would have to do to have a certain % certainty of having at least one babblebrick from a gblock of n babblebricks. The results of this eventually caused us to order BabbleBricks in the form of primers rather than as gBlocks. This allowed a significant cost reduction as we did not have to do as many sequencing reactions.
